 This week, I put my focus into the third component of the Fit4Life application, creatingChildren. What this sandbox does is taking an array and creating a new div for each of the points within the array. The main reason for having this component is to avoid having to create too many new containers since we can never guarantee that the workouts will have the same amount of exercises. To complete this task, I had to brush up on Dom manipulation using Javascript. Originally, I tried building a table, but I kept getting stuck when adding the cell data. Next, I attempted using an unordered list and I wasn’t liking the stock decoration that was built in with the list items. I finally settled with creating generic divs because it allows for a better baseline to use with CSS.
 My meeting this week was with Jacob Holman and I didn’t receive very much feedback from him. So far, he agrees with what I have been accomplishing and he has expressed his curiosity as to whether it will be implemented by the Fit4Life program.
