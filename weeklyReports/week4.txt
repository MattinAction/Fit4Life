  There is a valuable lesson that I learned this week and that is CSS is definitely a finicky and stubborn concept to execute. My goal for the week was getting the Crossfit workouts to pull from the Google Sheets and then organize in a readable fashion; it was essentially the initial combination of the XMLHTTPRequest and the Physical display of the application. Now that I have the first stage figured out, I should be able to complete the other two fairly smoothly. 
  For my meeting I met again with Joseph to discuss a particular question that I had. In the realm of exercise physiology there’s a method of training called a Superset. In these supersets, multiple exercises are tied together to be executed in one go. The simplest way that I could describe it to a programmer is think of a for loop with each exercise being listed within the loop. The problem that I was running into was that I needed to signify that if there was a superset in the workout and which exercises comprised the superset. We arrived that adding an asterisk to the beginning of the exercise name should be a significant enough of an identifier. Now, I’m sure that Brother Barney will disagree with this, but I am already planning on completely overhauling the UI once I get a working Alpha set up.
