 This weekâ€™s focus was all about the user interface of the web application. After meeting with Brother Barney I had good ideas of what would be seen as a good design to provide the users with the best experience possible. Following the plan that I had described last week, I was taking the sandboxing approach in developing the user interface. The key challenge here that I ran into was getting the transitions to run correctly in the instance that the user selected different programs. Also, I added in the feature that the application would remember the last workout program that the user had accessed and on the next startup, it would pull that program instead of the default Crossfit.
 Since I was spending all of my time working on the user interface and I had already received guidance from Brother Barney as to what features should be implemented, I used my mentor meeting to meet with Joseph Williams. He was able to give me a decent idea as to what features he would prefer the application to have. Between the two I was able to develop a decent sandbox and I have posted a screenshot below.
