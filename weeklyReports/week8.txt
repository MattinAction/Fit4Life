Reporting: Week 8
   The struggle continues. I’m still working on combining my components into a completed prototype. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get everything completed in this week. One of the main steps that I worked on this week was getting the function where the workouts are pulled from Google Sheets ready to be refactored. My goal in refactoring this code was to be able to pull the data from each of the 3 Google Sheets without needing to call three separate functions. I am close with getting everything combined and having it functioning, but some work still needs to take place.
   As for facing the presentation, I have been working on a general outline for the points that I want to discuss, but it hasn’t been going very smoothly. For delivery of this presentation, I plan on using the a mind map to present the information and then have a video recording of myself providing the detail on my speaking points.
   This brings me to a different point that I have been seeing throughout the entire project, I need to use the projects and opportunities around me to learn new topics and then see what new points of technology can be pulled from these topics. For example, I plan on using a green screen to clean up the background of my “talking head” video. Also, depending on the method that I use for my mind map, I might have to use frame transitions to manipulate where the screen is focused.
