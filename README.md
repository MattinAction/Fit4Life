# Fit4Life

 Main Problem: While participating in the Fit4Life program, one of the largest issues that I noticed with the program is getting the workouts supplied to the individual participants. Currently, they would email out the a .pdf file that has the workouts for the week listed on them. Either that or they have folders for the participants that have the workouts placed in them. 
  
 Solution: To assist this this problem, this web application will deliver the workouts to the participants. They will be able to select what program they would like the workout for and then it will display that workout.
  
 Challenges: Since I would like to pass the responsibility of the Exercise Physiology to update the workouts on a weekly basis, creating a Content Management System that someone without programming experience would be able to update. To aid in this situation, I have used Google Sheets as a replacement for a traditional database.

 Resources: The most important resource that I will need to complete this project will be my computer which has my IDE loaded onto it. Other than that, I required a hosting service. For this I am going to be using a company named SiteGround.

 Major Tasks/Milestones:
1) Sandbox: Connecting XMLHTTPRequest from Google Sheets
2) Sandbox: UI for the application
3) Sandbox: Building the workouts from array
4) Combining the sandbox code into a functioning application
5) Polishing the CSS to match the program’s brand
6) Prepare the presentation to be brought to the Fit4Life leadership
7) Deliver the Fit4Life Application to leadership
8) Begin to convert application to iOS platform (optional)
9) If accepted, work with the school’s IT department to implement the application

 Testing Strategy: My testing strategy has two main components. First, I am separating out each component of the application in their own sandbox code. This will allow me to test out each component without having problems from the other components interfering with the component that I am currently testing. Second, after the application becomes functional, I will personally test the use of the application as I go through this round of Fit4Life for the semester. This testing phase will last for 3 weeks while I am doing the polish phase of the application.

 Grading:
A: An “A” level effort will result in a completed web application with the full use of the Google Sheets CMS that can be updated by the Exercise Physiology department as they are working through the course of their program. The application will be presented to the Fit4Life administration and it will also match the Fit4Life brand. It will be complete to ensure a relatively light implementation cycle for the BYUI IT department.

B: Styling of the application does not quite match the Fit4Life brand, but the meeting is still prepared to present the application to the Fit4Life leadership.

C: Styling is minimalistic and does not match the Fit4Life brand at all. Presentation to the Fit4Life leadership is not set up. Application functions

D: Components are built out and function in their own sandboxes, but are never combined. No communication with Fit4Life leadership takes place.

F: Student failed to complete any sandboxing of the components required to develop the application.
