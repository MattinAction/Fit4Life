# Fit4Life

  Problem: While participating in the Fit4Life program, one of the largest issues that I noticed with the program is getting the workouts supplied to the individual participants. Currently, they would email out the a .pdf file that has the workouts for the week listed on them. Either that or they have folders for the participants that have the workouts placed in them. 
  
  Solution: To assist this this problem, this web application will deliver the workouts to the participants. They will be able to select what program they would like the workout for and then it will dislay that workout.
  
  Challenges: Since I would like to pass the responsibility of the Exercise Physiology to update the workouts on a weekly basis, creating a Content Management System that someone without programming experience would be able to update. To aid in this situation, I have used Google Sheets as a replacement for a traditional database.
